BrightnessImgCharMatcher.java - Contains the matcher which converts the images into a 2d array of chars.
CharRenderer.java - Renders each character to a 2d array of booleans representing the char
Driver.java - Main method to run the code.
Shell.java - Controls the shell commands given to print, add and remove characters for the characters
used to render the picture as well as render format and render resolution of the picture.
FileImage.java - Controls the FileImage instance which is the object used to for splitting into
sub images.
Image.java - Image interface describing the commands used on Image instances.
SubImages.java - SubImages class which provides an iterator over the sub images of the given picture.

=============================
In the following exercise, the additional implementation which was added is the additional SubImages
class. The following class holds a property which is a collection of the sub images of a given picture.
It provides an iterator over the subImages so they can be iterated in a convenient way.
In order to use the given class, an additional method was added to the Image interface which returns
a new instance of the SubImages class containing the collection of the sub images.
The default method returns an iterator over an empty SubImages object.

=============================
In the FileImage class, the method used for splitting the image into different sub images works in the
following way:
It treats each image as a grid of different sub images, creating each row in the grid and in each
row, creating each sub image.

=============================
1) Described above
2) Time Complexity:
Denote the number of pixels in the given picture by n.
Notice that the number of pixels in the FileImage generated (meaning generating the image that it's
height and width are the closest power of two values to our dimensions) is O(n).
meaning, generating the FileImage instance takes O(n) as well.
Furthermore, since generating all the sub images of the given image requires a single run on it,
the process takes O(n) as well.
Now, notice that the amount of sub images is O(n) since every sub image can be a single pixel of the
given image.
Time complexity of the first run:
First, notice that there is a constant amount of characters (since we at most take all of the characters
which is a bounded amount). Then, notice that calculating the brightness of each character takes a
constant time as well. Afterwards, we calculate the most fitting character for each sub image, iterating
through all of the sub images and obtaining the most fitting character for it. Notice that finding the
best character is done by iterating all of the characters making O(1) actions for each.
So obtaining the chars is done by O(n) and the total run time is O(n) as well.
Time complexity of the second run:
In order to save the brightness of each char used, I have used the Map collection which maps
from a character to a float value representing it's brightness value.
Notice that using the map we can easily access values of previous characters used for the given image,
saving the time calculating the brightness again. The process afterwards is the same so the total run
time is O(n) as well.
Space complexity:
Denote the number of pixels in the given picture by n.
Notice that saving the picture then takes O(n) space and saving the "normalized" picture (the picture
that it's height and width are powers of 2) takes O(n) as well.
In addition, space O(n) space was used for saving the SubImages and a constant amount of space was used
for storing the hashmap mapping characters to their value. Therefore, making the space Complexity O(n)
as well.
